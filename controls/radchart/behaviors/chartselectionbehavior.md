# Selection Behavior

The **ChartSelectionBehavior** is a type of visualization that allow users to "select" point of the series. This behavior can bring much more user interactivity to RadChart and make the data in the chart much easier to understand.

## Properties

* **SeriesSelectionMode**: Gets or sets the **ChartSelectionMode** that controls the selection behavior of the chart series.
	* **None**
	* **Single**
	* **Multiple**
* **DataPointSelectionMode**: Gets or sets the **ChartSelectionMode** that controls the selection behavior of the data points within the chart series.
* **TouchTargetOverhang**: Gets or sets the **Thickness** structure that will be used when calculating the touch rectangle.
* **SelectedPoints**: Retrieves all the points from all series within the chart plot area that are currently selected.
* **SelectedSeries**: Retrieves all the series instances within the plot area that are currently selected.

Here is the XAML definition:
```XML
<telerik:RadCartesianChart.Behaviors>
    <telerik:ChartSelectionBehavior DataPointSelectionMode="Multiple"/>
</telerik:RadCartesianChart.Behaviors>
```

## Cartesian Series Types
We've added performance optimizations to the Chart control drawing mechanisms. Part of this optimization prevents the selection behavior from operating as expected. In these cases, adding the following approach will be needed.

1. Create a custom class that inherits from `ContainerVisualsFactory` and override the **CanDrawContainerVisual** method:

```C#
public class MyContainerVisualFactory : ContainerVisualsFactory
{
    protected override bool CanDrawContainerVisual(PresenterBase visualElement)
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

2. Apply the custom class to the ContainerVisualsFactory property of the Chart:

```XML
<telerikChart:RadCartesianChart.ContainerVisualsFactory>
   <local:MyContainerVisualFactory/>
</telerikChart:RadCartesianChart.ContainerVisualsFactory>
```
