# Getting Started

This topic demonstrates how to start using RadRating for {{ site.framework_name }}.

First you should add references to the required assemblies:

* **Telerik.Core.dll**
* **Telerik.UI.Xaml.Primitives.dll**
* **Telerik.UI.Xaml.Input.dll**

Then, the following namespace has to be declared:
	
	xmlns:telerikInput="using:Telerik.UI.Xaml.Controls.Input"

Here is how RadRating is declared in XAML:
	
	<telerikInput:RadRating />

In C#:
	
	RadRating rating = new RadRating();

The number of rating items can be changed by using one of the following approaches:

* **AutoGeneratedItemsCount** property.
* Manually adding items of type RadRatingItem.

Here are the examples for creating a rating with 3 items using each of the methods:

	<telerikInput:RadRating AutoGeneratedItemsCount="3" />	

	<telerikInput:RadRating>
	    <telerikInput:RadRatingItem/>
	    <telerikInput:RadRatingItem/>
	    <telerikInput:RadRatingItem/>
	</telerikInput:RadRating>

> Only one of the methods for defining the number of items should be used.
If you try to add items manually when the AutoGeneratedItemsCount is set, or try to set this property
when the current items have been added manually, this would cause an exception.
