## DataStorage provider for RadDataGrid for Windows Universal

**[Telerik Data Storage]({%slug datastorage-overview%})** for Windows Universal facilitates the communication with the
 SQL database, which can be a serious overhead for a non C++ developer,
who is not familiar with the native Windows Runtime development paradigms.

The **RadDataGrid DataStorage Provider** connects **RadDataGrid** with **Telerik Data Storage** 
seamlessly and it is able to modify the data directly.

Some advantages using DataStorage provider:

* Binding Grid with local SQLite data with 2 lines of code;
* Automatic handling of CRUD operation between the RadDataGrid and Data Storage.

The scenarios this feature enables are:

Combining **Data Storage** and **DataProvider** one can now persists or cache its data locally and visualize and manipulate it directly in **RadDataGrid** with no additional code required. This enables your application to work in offline mode persisting and modifying the data locally within your local SQLite instance through RadDataGrid UI.
