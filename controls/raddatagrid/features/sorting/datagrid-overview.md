# Overview

The RadGridView provides you with a built-in sorting functionality, which allows the user to easily sort the data by one or several columns.

>RadDataGrid allows sorting through the UI(by click/tap on the Column Header) and also programmatic sorting which can be achieved through using the **RadDataGrid.SortDescriptors** property by adding SortDescriptor(s).

RadDataGrid provides two ways of sorting:

* by Property - using a [PropertySortDescriptor]({%slug datagrid-sorting-propertynamesortdescriptor%})
* by custom Key - using a [DelegateSortDescriptor]({%slug datagrid-sorting-delegatesortdescriptor%})
