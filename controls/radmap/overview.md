# Overview

A map control is a data visualization control whose primary purpose is to visualize rich spatial data.
The control is ultra fast thanks to the native C++ library, using Direct2D for rendering the RadMap's shapes.
It can display spatial data from ESRI shapefiles, as well as any user defined content in a geographical context.
