# Overview

Thank you for using RadHubTile for {{ site.framework_name }}!

RadHubTile is a rectangular UI element designed specifically to update itself dynamically and show the latest up to date information from different services or apps even when they are not running.

There are five variations of RadHubTile which differ in the type of information they visualize and variety of effects:

* [RadHubTile]({%slug radhubtile-radhubtile%}) is a tile used to display information such as how many notifications you have in your inbox, or how many tasks are left in your TODO list, etc.
* [RadSlideHubTile]({%slug radhubtile-radslidehubtile%}) contains two pieces of contents where you can put text or pictures. The visual effect supported by this tile includes three states:
	* Shows the bottom content.
	* Shows the top half of the bottom content and the bottom half of the top content. 
	* Shows the top content.
* [RadPictureRotatorHubTile]({%slug radhubtile-radpicturerotatorhubtile%}) displays one picture at a time and rotates random pictures of a collection of image URIs.
* [RadMosaicHubTile]({%slug radhubtile-radmosaichubtile%}) consists of smaller tiles, which flip randomly to show pictures from a collection of image URIs.
* [RadCustomHubTile]({%slug radhubtile-radcustomhubtile%})is a custom HubTile that allows you to put anything from text to a dynamically updating mini UI in it.
