## Key features

* **Setting Shadow Color**: Although in most cases shadows are of black color, RadShadow exposes a **Color** property, so you can easily add color to the shadow effect.

* **Defining Transparency**: Through the **ShadowOpacity** property you can set the transparency-level of the shadows you’re using. 

* **Defining Shadow Position**: RadShadow provides **OffsetX** and **OffsetY** properties used to define its position relative to the UI it wraps around. You can practically place the shadow in every direction according to the design requirements you have.

* **Applying Corner Radius**: You can apply a corner radius to the shadow to make it consistent to the view it wraps around. With the help of **CornerRadius** property you can soften the view’s edges and make them look more natural. 

* **Applying Blur Radius**: Through the **BlurRadius** property you can adjust the blur level to make the shadow look softer.
